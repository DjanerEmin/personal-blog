```{r, eval=FALSE}
  help("R")
```

Hey there! Iâ€™m here to teach R the way I wished I was taught. Coming from non-computer science field I faced struggles grasping the fundamentals. Now, 10 years later, I want to help people learn faster.

Donâ€™t go through the struggle aloneâ€”let me help you navigate R with confidence!

âœ¨ Gain practical skills for data analysis - Clear explanations of tough concepts.

[R-programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) is part of my professional life. Now, I want to also teach it as a hobby. So I am giving a limited number of tutoring sessions absolutely for free! Just get in touch by mail.
